# Phase 2 Implementation Summary

## Overview
Phase 2 of the Cache Improvement Plan has been successfully implemented. This phase adds automatic duplicate detection that identifies commands returning identical results and marks them as never-cache.

## Implementation Details

### New Files Created
1. **src/duplicate-detector.ts**
   - DuplicateDetector class with event-driven architecture
   - SHA256 hashing for result comparison
   - 5-second detection window
   - Memory-efficient history tracking (max 10 entries per command)

### Files Modified
1. **src/tools/command/ai-command-enhancer.ts**
   - Added imports for duplicate detection and cache management
   - Added event listener in constructor for 'duplicate-detected' events
   - Integrated duplicate checking after fresh command executions
   - Auto-clears cache for detected duplicates

2. **src/tools/cache-management-tools.ts**
   - Added optional `isRegex` property to LearnedRule interface

## How It Works

### Detection Process
1. Every command execution result is hashed using SHA256
2. Results are tracked with timestamps in a rolling window
3. If 2 identical results occur within 5 seconds, a duplicate is detected
4. The 'duplicate-detected' event is emitted

### Auto-Learning Flow
1. When duplicate detected, the command is automatically:
   - Marked as never-cache with high priority
   - Saved to persistent storage (preparation for Phase 3)
   - Cleared from the current cache
   - Logged for monitoring

### Example Scenario
```
User runs: ls -la
Result: [directory listing]

User runs: ls -la (within 5 seconds)
Result: [same directory listing]
→ Duplicate detected!
→ "ls -la" marked as never-cache
→ Future executions won't use cache

User runs: ls -la (later)
Result: Fresh execution every time
```

## Key Features
- ✅ Automatic pattern detection
- ✅ Event-driven architecture
- ✅ SHA256 content hashing
- ✅ Configurable detection window (5 seconds)
- ✅ Configurable threshold (2 duplicates)
- ✅ Memory-efficient history tracking
- ✅ Integration with cache management

## Testing
Test files created:
- `test/test-phase2-duplicate.js` - Tests duplicate detection logic
- Shows detection window behavior
- Demonstrates statistics and history management

## Integration with Phase 1
- Uses `saveLearningRule()` from Phase 1 to prepare for persistence
- Uses `cacheClassifier.addRule()` to immediately apply learned behavior
- Uses `aiCache.clearCommand()` to remove detected duplicates from cache

## Next Steps
Phase 3 will add persistent storage so learned rules survive server restarts. The infrastructure is already in place with the `saveLearningRule()` calls.

## Performance Considerations
- History limited to 10 entries per command
- Old entries automatically pruned
- SHA256 hashing is fast and consistent
- Event-driven design minimizes overhead
