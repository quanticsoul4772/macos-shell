# Phase 1 Implementation Summary

## Overview
Phase 1 of the Cache Improvement Plan has been successfully implemented. This phase adds cache management MCP tools that allow Claude to manage cache behavior at runtime without code changes.

## Implementation Details

### New Files Created
1. **src/tools/cache-management-tools.ts**
   - Contains 5 new MCP tools for cache management
   - Helper functions for persistent storage (will be used in Phase 3)
   - Exports LearnedRule interface and saveLearningRule function

### Files Modified
1. **src/ai-cache.ts**
   - Added `keyToCommandMap` to track command-to-key mappings
   - Added `clearCommand()` method to clear specific commands
   - Added `clearPattern()` method to clear by regex pattern
   - Added `commandMatchesKey()` helper method
   - Modified `set()` method to track command mappings

2. **src/tools/command-tools.ts**
   - Added import for registerCacheManagementTools
   - Added call to register the cache management tools

## New MCP Tools

### 1. cache_clear_command
- Clears specific command from cache
- Optional: can clear from specific directory or all directories
- Returns count of cleared entries

### 2. cache_clear_pattern
- Clears cache entries matching a regex pattern
- Validates regex before execution
- Returns count of cleared entries

### 3. cache_mark_never
- Marks a command or pattern to never be cached
- Saves rule to persistent storage (prep for Phase 3)
- Includes reason for marking

### 4. cache_stats
- Returns comprehensive cache statistics
- Shows cache size, hit rate, patterns
- Includes count of learned rules

### 5. cache_explain
- Explains cache decision for a specific command
- Shows classification, TTL, and reasoning
- Useful for debugging cache behavior

## Testing
A test file has been created at `test/test-phase1-cache.js` to verify:
- Adding items to cache
- Clearing specific commands
- Clearing by pattern
- Cache classification behavior

## Next Steps
Phase 1 provides the foundation for dynamic cache management. Phase 2 will add automatic duplicate detection to intelligently mark commands as never-cache based on usage patterns.

## Usage Example
```typescript
// Clear all cached 'git status' commands
await cache_clear_command({ command: 'git status' });

// Clear all commands starting with 'ls'
await cache_clear_pattern({ pattern: '^ls' });

// Mark a command to never be cached
await cache_mark_never({ 
  command: 'docker ps',
  isPattern: false,
  reason: 'Container status changes frequently'
});

// Get cache statistics
const stats = await cache_stats({});

// Explain why a command will/won't be cached
const explanation = await cache_explain({ command: 'pwd' });
```
