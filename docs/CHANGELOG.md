### Added
- **Cache System** - 4-phase caching system
  - 5 new cache management MCP tools
  - Duplicate detection
  - Persistent learning storage (~/.mcp-cache-rules.json)
  - Output analysis for dynamic content detection
  - Pattern detection for timestamps, PIDs, counters, file sizes, IPs
- **Cache Management Tools**:
  - `cache_stats` - View cache statistics and performance
  - `cache_clear_command` - Clear specific commands
  - `cache_clear_pattern` - Clear by regex pattern
  - `cache_mark_never` - Mark commands to never cache
  - `cache_explain` - Explain cache decisions

### Changed
- Reduced buffer sizes from 10,000 to 300 lines for AI-optimized memory usage
- 97% memory reduction (1.6MB to 48KB per session)
- Added AI_BUFFER_SIZE constant in session-types.ts
- Updated tool count from 30 to 35 (added 5 cache management tools)

### Technical Details
- AI processes output immediately, doesn't need large scrollback
- 300 lines sufficient for command responses and error searching
- Cache system prevents stale data while improving performance
- Detection of dynamic vs static content

## [3.1.1] - 2025-01-06

### Fixed
- **Command Caching**: Fixed issue where status commands were being cached
  - Status commands like `git status`, `ls`, `docker ps` are now NEVER cached
  - Implemented cache classification system
  - Variable TTLs based on command type (never, 30s, 5m, 30m, 1h)
  - Added `MCP_DISABLE_CACHE=true` environment variable to disable caching

### Added
- `ai-cache-classifier.ts` - Classification of commands for caching decisions
- Cache strategy information in command responses (`cacheStrategy` field)
- `explainCache()` method to understand caching decisions
- Test scripts to verify caching behavior

### Changed
- Cache now respects command purpose - status commands get fresh data
- Updated AI cache to use classification system instead of blanket 30-minute cache
- Command result includes cache strategy information

### Technical Details
- Added rules for command classification
- Cache classifier uses regex patterns to identify command types
- Status/monitoring commands bypass cache
- Configuration files get medium caching (5 minutes)
- Static content like help text gets long caching (1 hour)

## [3.1.0] - 2025-06-08

### Added
- **Process Resource Monitoring**: CPU and memory tracking for background processes
  - Resource sampling for running processes
  - CPU percentage, memory usage (MB), and memory percentage tracking
  - 5-second sampling intervals
  - Data structure focused on current values
  - Resource data included in `list_processes` JSON output
- **Batched PS Execution**: Reduced monitoring overhead
  - Single `ps` command for all processes instead of individual calls
  - Batch sampling every 5 seconds for updates
  - Handling of up to 100 concurrent processes
- **Circuit Breaker Pattern**: Error handling for system commands
  - Failure detection after 3 consecutive errors
  - Exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s) before retries
  - 30-second recovery timeout for circuit reset
  - Degradation when ps command fails
- **Process API**: Resource data in responses
  ```json
  {
    "resources": {
      "cpu": 45.2,
      "memory": 1024,
      "memoryPercent": 12.5,
      "lastSampled": "2024-01-15T10:30:45.123Z",
      "sampleCount": 8,
      "samplingInterval": 5000
    }
  }
  ```

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: `list_processes` now returns JSON format instead of text
  - Structured data with nested resource information
  - Includes process metadata and resource monitoring status
  - For AI parsing and decision making
- Process monitoring starts when background process launches
- Monitoring stops and cleans up when process terminates

### Technical Details
- New `resource-monitor.ts` module with ResourceMonitor and CircuitBreaker classes
- Updated `BackgroundProcess` interface to include optional resources
- Modified `session-manager.ts` to integrate resource monitoring lifecycle
- `process-tools.ts` exposes resource data in structured format
- No test files - AI validates through usage
- No sample history storage - only current values tracked
- Cleanup of resource data 5 seconds after process termination

### For AI Usage
- Removed trend analysis - AI only needs current values
- Fixed 5-second intervals
- Removed statistics and aggregation methods
- Data: CPU%, memory MB, sample count

### Performance
- Overhead: <1% CPU for monitoring 50 processes
- Memory: <2MB for tracking 100 processes (no sample history)
- Sampling efficiency: One ps execution per interval regardless of process count
